Bearing calculations:

Draw a free-body diagram
We know the load of the chain and the dimension - distance between parts
setting the sums of the moments and forces to zero give the reaction forces of the bearings

check axial forces

check max rpm of motor, check gear ratio to see the max rpm that bearing experiences - we also need to know the shaft diameters for this 

Plan:
Use on shape to get dimensions a, b, (c and d)
Use matlab torsion script to find the lowest shaft diameter that can be chosen
created a matlab script where you input the max chain force and it outputs the radial forces on each bearing

find a bearing that meets the 3 criteria 
rated for max rpm of 8000
is rated for a shaft diameter that is within a suitable safety factor from torsion code
can withstand the radial forces on it
